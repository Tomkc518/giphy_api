# Giphy API Magic!


In this homework it was all about using the Giphy API!

I learned how to use AJAX to pull the data, access the JSON and pull the correct information.

So when you click on a button it pulls the first 10 gifs

These gifs can then be clicked and start their animate gif, and if you click again they go back to static

You can also add whatever animal you would like as a new button and click that and get new gifs!
